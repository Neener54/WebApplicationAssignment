This project demonstrates the use of three public APIs, they are as follows:
1. Youtube Public API
2. Twitter Public API
3. Github Public API

All of the above API are interacted with this application using different ways. For instance: 

1. For Youtube Public API, I have used official google docs for Ruby language.

2. For Twitter, I have used twitter gem.

3. For Github Public API, I have used net/https library.
